# About

I studied mathematics and computer science at Pomona College, graduating in 2019. I am currently a software engineer at Facebook. I like to expand my skill set outside of work by learning new topics and working on projects.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy reading, road & mountain biking, hiking, skiing, and playing piano and drums.
