# About

I studied mathematics and computer science at Pomona College, graduating in 2019. I am currently a software engineer at Facebook. I've become quite interested in machine learning, and spend much of my free time studing ML and working on projects.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy reading, road & mountain biking, hiking, skiing, and playing piano and drums.
