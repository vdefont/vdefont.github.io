# GeoGuessrBot: Predicting the Country and Location of Any Street View Image

Our key contributions are as follows:
- A novel dataset consisting of 97,068 Street View images uniformly sampled from 87 countries
- A model that predicts an image's country with 75% accuracy (94% top-5 accuracy)
- A model that predicts the US State of an image with 64% accuracy (90% top-5 accuracy)
- A model that locates an image within 25km (16 miles) in 9% of cases, within 200km (124 miles) in 39% of cases, or within 750km (466 miles) in 72% of cases
